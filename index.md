WADComs is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of offensive security tools and their respective commands, to be used against Windows/AD environments.  

If you hate constantly looking up the right command to use against a Windows or Active Directory environment (like me), this project should help ease the pain a bit. Just select what information you currently have related to the Windows machine (passwords, usernames, services, etc.), and it will display a list of tools you can try against the machine, along with a template command for easy copy/pasting. See the full list of [items](/items/) and [filters](/filters/).

This project was created by [John Woodman](https://twitter.com/JohnWoodman15) and was inspired by [GTFOBins][GTFOBins] and [LOLBAS][LOLBAS]. I relied heavily on [GTFOBins'][GTFOBins] site template to make this one.

I'm hoping to make WADComs a [collaborative project][collaborative], so please feel free to [contribute][contribute] your commands.
